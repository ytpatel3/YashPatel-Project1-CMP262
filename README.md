Project Purpose: Identify what methods/strategies CCM can employ to increase enrollment into the CCM computing degrees/programs.

Answer these 4 questions:
1. Which events had computing degree students attended prior to coming to CCM? Show a bar chart of this field, sorted from highest to lowest.  Do not include any events which were not attended.
2. Look at the records of just the Computing Majors only as one group. Computing Majors include: Computer Science, IT, Game Dev, Digital Media Technology, Technical Studies, Information Security, Data Analytics and Web Development. What were the main sources from which they received information about CCMâ€™s computing programs? 
3. Which were the greatest motivations to seek a computing degree/certificate at CCM (to get a job, transfer to bachelor's level program, etc.)? 
4. Which degree program had the highest number of participants (computer science, information technology, etc.)? (pie chart)


Relevant Files:

- Majors Survey Results - Fall 2021.csv (original dataset)

- cleaned_data.csv (cleaned dataset)

- yash-patel-data-cleaning.ipynb (part 2 ipynb)
    - This Jupyter notebook will perform data cleaning using pandas on the original dataset to create a new dataset titled, 'cleaned_data.csv'
    - Used .drop() method to remove any irrelevant data columns and non-computing major rows
    - Used .rename() method to make dataset more digestible

- yash-patel-project1-part3.ipynb (part 3 ipynb)
    - This Jupyter notebook will perform the data visualizations using Matplotlib to answer the 4 questions.
    - Used pandas to read from csv file, and quanitfy data. 
    - Used Matplotlib to create bar graphs and pie charts to visualize data. 
    - Analysis is performed in the notebook using Markdown comments.
